# Why interesting!
- low power
- cheap calculations
- low storage
- Explainableeeeeee

# What historical!
- Michael Lvovitch Tsetlin
- Ole-Christoffer Granmo of Agder

# Top down explanation

## Machine
- Boolean inputs mapped to literals
- classify A or B
- confidence metric
- majority vote via ingeger sum of clauses

## Clause
- gets all literals
- considers only those used by automata
- AND-SUM, 0 or 1

## Automaton
- Holds opinion on literal relevancy for a clause
- low values are certainly irrelevant
- high values are certainly relevant
- middle is uncertain
- ONLY MOVABLE PART
- i.e. can be trained

# Example of a Tsetlin machine in action - car classifier?
- pre-trained!

# How to train yes?
- too complex to go through
- but do a a live example

# Explainable yes!
- Rewrite trained car identifier logic to English
